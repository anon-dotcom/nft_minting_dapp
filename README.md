@welcome

This is my test release minting dapp utlizing source code from the Hashlips minting platform.

to serve via localhost:

```
npm run start
```

to create build:

```
npm run build
```

Contents of build folder can be hosted.

The contract "TestRelease1.sol" works with the Dapp

The contract "Test2R.sol" is the contract with refundability implemented.

TThe current goal is to implement refundability in to both the front-end and Test2R Contract.
