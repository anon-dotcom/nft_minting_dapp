@welcome

This is my test release minting dapp utlizing source code from the Hashlips minting platform.
```

After all the changes you can run.

```sh
npm run start
```

Or create the build if you are ready to deploy.

```sh
npm run build
```

Now you can host the contents of the build folder on a server.

That's it! you're done.
